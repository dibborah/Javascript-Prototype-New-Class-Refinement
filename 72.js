// console.log(this);
// console.log(window);

// this keyword => window => Same thing
// this => gives window object which is the global object of Javascript

// this <=> window

// "use strict"
// function myFunc(){
//     console.log(this);
//     // console.log("hello universe");
// }
// myFunc();// this function cannot console the window object when called directly in strict mode ("use strict")
// one has to call it via the window object as call the function as a property of the window object using the .(dot) operator
// window.myFunc();// here the func can be called directly even in "use strict" mode
// "use strict" mode is used by js developers in js to put more restriction in js as js is a very forgiving language
